# Instalock

This is project Instalock. It's a simple native android app which shows some statistics of summoners in the game League of Legends. 

## Prerequisites

In order to run this app, you need to install Android studio and the SDK needed within. (Perhaps i will deploy this app in the play store, still considering...)

## Dependencies 

In order to fetch the data there were many ways. I could have used the original Riot games API to fetch some realtime summoner data (matches played, scores, etc.), to fetch the "static" data of the game (champions, items, etc. ) i couldve have used the community API called cdragon. 

Instead i used the Orianna library. It's an awesome Java library with build in classes and functions which does all the work for you.
